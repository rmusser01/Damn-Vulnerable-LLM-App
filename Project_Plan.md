Project Plan

generated with Sonnet 3.5

1. Application Framework: FastAPI
	Set up a FastAPI project structure
	Implement dependency injection for configuration and services
	Use Pydantic models for request/response validation

2. LLM Integration
	Use llamafile to run local LLMs
	Setup function calls (litellm?)
	Set up configuration for model paths and parameters

3. Vulnerable Features
	- Features
	- Challenges & Challenge Tiers
		- Tier 1: Basic Vulnerabilities
			1. Prompt Injection
				- Setup: 
					* Create an endpoint that uses user input as part of the system prompt
					* Demonstrate how users can manipulate the system prompt
   				- Challenge: Make the assistant reveal the system prompt
   				- Hint: Try asking the assistant about its instructions
			2. Data Leakage
				- Setup:
					* Store sensitive information in the application's memory or a file
					* Create challenges where users must extract this information
   				- Challenge: Extract a hidden "flag" from the assistant's knowledge
   				- Hint: The flag is hidden in the assistant's training data
   			3. Denial-of-Service
   				- Setup:
   				- Challenge:
   				- Hint: 
   			4. API Key Exposure
   				- Setup:
   					* Create a downloadable library/sample implementation for interacting with X endpoint
   						* Embed the straight api key / obfuscated API key (encoded) / Encrypted API key (using symmetric encryption) 
   				- Challenge: Find the API key that was overlooked/ignored by the secret scanning tools at LLM inc
   				- Hint: 
		- Tier 2: Intermediate Exploits
			1. Overreliance on LLM Outputs
   				- Setup:
   					* Create a function that operates on LLM generated data, without performing any/some/strong analysis of the generated content
   				- Challenge:
   				- Hint: 
			2. Model Misuse
				- Setup: 
					* Create a content moderation feature using the LLM
					* Demonstrate how it can be bypassed to generate harmful content
				- Challenge: Bypass content moderation to generate restricted content
			    - Hint: Use creative rewording and indirect language
			3. Unauthorized Access (SSRF / Agent Abuse)
				- Setup:
					* Implement role-based access control
					* Show how lower-privilege users might gain access to restricted capabilities
			    - Challenge: Gain access to a restricted capability
   				- Hint: Explore weaknesses in the role-based access control
			4. Prompt Leakage
			    - Challenge: Extract parts of the system prompt without direct access
   				- Hint: Use carefully crafted questions to make the model reveal its instructions
		- Tier 3: Advanced Techniques
			1. Model Inversion
			    - Challenge: Reconstruct part of the training data
			    - Hint: Use repeated, targeted queries to extract specific information
			2. Adversarial Attacks
			    - Challenge: Make the model consistently produce incorrect outputs
			    - Hint: Craft inputs that exploit the model's weaknesses or biases
			3. Jailbreaking
			    - Challenge: Completely bypass the model's ethical training
   				- Hint: Combine multiple techniques, including role-play and context manipulation
			4. Insecure Output Handling
				- Setup:
					* Implement a feature that directly renders LLM output in HTML
					* Show how this can lead to XSS/other attacks
			    - Challenge: Make the assistant generate an XSS payload
   				- Hint: Ask the assistant to create an HTML script tag
			    - Challenge: Get the model to create a file that will trigger xss/X attack when the returned answer is displayed to the user
   				- Hint:
   					* Ask the AI assistant to create a sample webpage for your school project you've been assigned.
   					* "Sometimes, people don't look where they're going. LLMs, they don't even know what they're saying...." 
		- Tier 4: Expert Exploits
			1. Data Poisoning - Ha. Will just be an infobit about it/approaches
			    - Challenge: Influence the model's behavior through its fine-tuning process
			    - Hint: If fine-tuning is available, craft data that introduces specific biases
			2. Privacy Violations - 
			    - Challenge: Extract personal information that shouldn't be in the model (? Need to think on this)
			    - Hint: Probe the model's knowledge about specific individuals or events
			3. Prompt Chaining ('Advanced' Jailbreaking)
			    - Challenge: Create a series of prompts that, when combined, produce a harmful result
			    - Hint: Break down a complex task into seemingly innocent sub-tasks

4. User Interface
	Use FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI for API documentation and testing
	Implement a simple frontend using a framework like Vue.js or React

5. Documentation
	Use FastAPI's built-in documentation features
	Create detailed markdown files explaining each vulnerability
	Include real-world examples and potential impacts
6. Deployment
	Create a Dockerfile for the application
	Provide docker-compose file for easy local deployment
	Include instructions for running the app with and without Docker
7. Security Measures
	Implement rate limiting using FastAPI middleware
	Add input sanitization for all user inputs
	Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
8. Challenges/CTF
	Implement a point system for successful exploits
	Create a leaderboard API endpoint
	Design challenges of varying difficulty levels
9. Monitoring and Logging
	Use FastAPI's logging features to track requests and responses
	Implement a simple dashboard using FastAPI's templates to display logs and statistics
10. Additional Challenges and Security Issues
